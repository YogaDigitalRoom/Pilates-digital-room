# Pilates Digital Room

Welcome to the Pilates Digital Room project! ðŸŒŸ

This project is a personal initiative where I am combining my passion for health, wellness, and web development. Iâ€™m building my own website from scratch using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** as I learn and grow in web design and development.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building scalable applications with SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generation).
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework to style my project with a clean and responsive design.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with reusable components.
- **Vercel**: Hosting platform to deploy and showcase the project.
